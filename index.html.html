    <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
         (computation) automatically.</p> 
    <p id="p2">Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.
            These programs enable computers</p> 
    <p id="p3">to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that i
          ncludes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term
           may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>
    <div class="class1">
        <p id="inP">A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave
        ovens and</p> 
        <a href="#">Google</a>
        <p>remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as 
            general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, 
            which links billions of other computers and users.</p>
